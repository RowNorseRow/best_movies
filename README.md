# My Favorite Movie Website

## Description 

#### I have used three separate python files to create a website that displays my favorite movies. When you click on a movie, a video of that movie's trailer will pop up and play the trailer. To close the video all you need to do is click somewhere on the screen outside of the video. The video will stop playing and return to the list of movies. Pretty cool, huh?

## Contents
  - `fresh_tomatoes.py`
    - This is the file that contains all the code for designing the website and how it will be displayed using HTML and CSS.
  
 - `entertainment_center.py` 
    - this is the file that contains each movies information to run through `movie_class.py` using Python. 
  
 - `movie_class.py`
    - This is the file that contains the movies class which allows you to run through all the movies in the `entertainment_center.py` file in th Python language. 

## Instructions
* #### You will first need to download the Python interpreter [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I've used version 2.7). 

* #### I suggest downloading Git as well if you plan on forking my repository. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - If you have trouble downloading Git you can visit [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site for help. 

* #### Next you will need to clone or download my repository [here](https://github.com/RowNorseRow/best_movies)
  - If you're unsure of how to do this, [this](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) link should help you get started with cloning repositories!
  - **Make sure you save all files in the same directory or the program will not work!**
  
* #### Open the directory in which you stored the cloned repository, then open the `best_movies` file. 

* #### You should then see the `The_Best_Movies_files` file. Open that. 

* #### Find the `movie_website.html` file. Double click that and it will open the webpage displaying all my favorite movies!
